We should probably put basic, all-encompassing guidelines here, but we haven't
discussed that much, yet.  
So, this is all easily changed:

 - Do not commit directly to master (after we start real development)
 - When creating a branch, make a branch of the form {ISUid}/{branchname}
   - e.g. if your email is asdf@iastate.edu, and you're making a branch to add
     "cool feature number three", your branch name should be
     `asdf/cool_feature_3` or something like that
 - Pull request guidelines TBD
 - Style guides TBD; main points on that are likely to be:
   - Code is *easy to understand*
   - Code is *easy to read*
   - Functions/methods/classes/etc. are *documented*
   - Code formatting and (perhaps to a lesser extent) style are *consistent*
   - 
   
To run server, go to Server -> NodeJS, then type npm start
